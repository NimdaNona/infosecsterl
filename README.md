# Sterling Mission Command Experience

An immersive, single-page cyber operations experience designed to showcase Sterling Thompson's impact across Regions Bank and Duke Energy. The interface simulates mission control, interactive incident response, threat hunting, automation workflows, and a deployment console for recruiters.

## Getting started

The project is implemented as a static web experience. To preview locally, open `index.html` in any modern browser. For deeper interactivity (audio, canvas effects), ensure JavaScript is enabled.

## Features

- **Cinematic landing** with animated starfield, dynamic counters, and HUD telemetry.
- **Mission Control hub** with an orbital dossier navigator, kinetic cursor, and keyboard-accessible wireframe schematics toggle.
- **Regions Bank simulations** including live incident orchestration, attack surface intelligence mesh, and continuous improvement loop explorer.
- **Interactive attack-surface countermeasures** letting visitors deploy Sterling's remediation waves, visualize risk links, and watch residual risk fall in real time.
- **Continuous improvement achievements** that unlock once every loop vector is explored, providing executive-ready highlights for recruiters.
- **Executive brief timeline** chronicling leadership updates across the Regions Bank escalation with expandable highlights.
- **Duke Energy simulations** covering tier-0 threat hunts with MITRE ATT&CK overlays, EDR tuning lab, and automation workflow conveyor.
- **Threat hunt intel toggles** contrasting baseline behavior vs. suspicious indicators for each hunt scenario.
- **Adaptive hunt terminal** that replays Splunk/EDR queries with a typewriter effect and honors reduced-motion preferences.
- **Narration console** delivering synthesized mission callouts, transcripts, and contextual guidance synchronized with user actions.
- **Skill hologram gallery** mapping core competencies to tangible artifacts.
- **Interactive skill orbit** letting reviewers jump directly to the mission sections that evidence each competency.
- **Impact command center** with filterable outcome dashboards and a persistent mission timeline ribbon.
- **Deployment console CTA** mimicking a secure terminal for next-step engagement, complete with a `battle_card` quick-brief command.
- **Battle card overlay & export** delivering an on-screen executive briefing with an accessible `download_battle_card` HTML export instead of binary assets.

## Accessibility & Responsiveness

The layout includes keyboard-focusable controls, live orbit hints, reduced-motion friendly animations (starfield + hunt playback), and responsive behavior for tablets and mobile devices. Audio can be toggled via the HUD sound control.

## Deployment

Host the repository on any static hosting provider (e.g., Vercel, Netlify, GitHub Pages). Ensure `index.html`, the `styles/`, `scripts/`, and `assets/` directories are served together.
